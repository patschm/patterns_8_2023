# Feed Reader
## Introduction
We've created a Feed reader to read news from a rss feed.
The data can be processed in different way (See TODO point in FeedReader).
This soultion is not workable. We have to change the FeedReader everytime we want a different way of processing the data.
Things are getting even uglier if we want to add another way of processing.
